# ErbilCafe

My First Project

Erbil Café's application is a general introduction of all Erbil cafes.

What is the purpose of creating this app or what is the workbook of this applet? 

The app aims to make it easier for users or residents of Erbil to choose and select their favorite café.

And also be clear about the cafes in Erbil,

Because the application contains the same information and features:

1. A summary of information about the café. 

2- Some pictures of that café to be sure of the environment of that café

3- Place the café on the map to make it easier to find the location of the café without using other map applications to find its location 

4- The list of foods and drinks of cafes is valuable so that the user is clear about the type of food and drinks and their prices
